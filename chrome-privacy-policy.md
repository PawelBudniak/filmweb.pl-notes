# Personal data
I, the extension owner, don't collect any user data nor do I have access to any user data, so no user data is stored remotely, and no user data can be sold to third parties.

# Storage
The extension saves the necessary information (movie notes and movie lengths) in [chrome sync storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage?hl=pl). This data is stored on Chrome servers and it allows your different devices logged into the same Chrome account to access the same data. My extension accesses this data locally on your device and do not transmit it anywhere.
